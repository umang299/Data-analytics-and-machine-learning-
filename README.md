### Introduction 
* The dataset i have used is Kaggle california housing prices [ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mohitgupta-omg/Kaggle-California-Housing-Prices/master/Data/housing.csv ] 
* Task is to predcit the **median housing price** values in different parts of california based on various other parameters.
* This is an example of **supervised batch learning multivariate regression** problem since the target variable is a continuous numeric value.   

### Selecting a perfromance metric 
* Since the feature data contains outliers its better to choose a metric and model that is less sensitive to outliers and doesnot overfit leading to poor performane on test data 
* Here i have used **mean_absolute_perentage_error** as a metric to evalute the performace ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/ndIXERr.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

### Discover and Visualise insights 
* Below is the histogram viualisation of numeric features
